Runway
======

### What is this?

The Models part of MVC as a service.

I noticed at TalkTo, and I'm assuming this is happening at CL, Strava and many other companies that each environment has its own MVC framework. Using TalkTo as an example, we had the Entity model (users, businesses, etc.) in:
 * Python (Django)
 * Javascript (Backbone)
 * Objective-C (iOS)
 * Java (Android)

The idea for Runway is a service where you created your models and then used an API to pull those models into each of your environments.
