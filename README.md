Runway
======

### What is this?

The Models part of MVC as a service.

Each environment has its own MVC framework. Using my previous startup as an example, we had the Entity model (users, businesses, etc.) in:

* Python (Django)
* Javascript (Backbone)
* Objective-C (iOS)
* Java (Android)

The idea for Runway is a service where you created your models and then used an API to pull those models into each of your environments.
